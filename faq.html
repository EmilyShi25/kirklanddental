        <p class="indent">A dentist is a specialist who works to diagnose, treat, and prevent oral health problems. Your dentist has completed at least eight years of schooling, and received either a DDS (Doctor of Dental Surgery) degree, or a DMD (Doctor of Dental Medicine) degree. If your doctor is a pediatric dentist, this means that he or she specializes in caring for children from infancy through their teen years. A pediatric dentist has received the proper education and training needed to work with young kids. Other specializations include:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Endodontics (root canals)</li>
          <li>Oral and maxillofacial (including pathology, radiology, and surgery)</li>
          <li>Orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics</li>
          <li>Periodontics (gum disease)</li>
          <li>Prosthodontics (implants)</li>

        <p class="indent">Visiting the dentist regularly will not only help keep your teeth and mouth healthy, but will also help keep the rest of your body healthy. Dental care is important because it:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Helps prevent tooth decay</li>
          <li>Protects against periodontal (gum) disease, which can lead to tooth and bone loss</li>
          <li>Prevents bad breath - brushing, flossing, and seeing the dentist regularly will help reduce the amount of bacteria in your mouth that causes bad breath</li>
          <li>Gives you a more attractive smile and increases your self-confidence</li>
          <li>Helps keep teeth looking bright by preventing them from becoming stained by food, drinks, and tobacco</li>
          <li>Strengthens your teeth so that you can enjoy healthy, beautiful smiles for the rest of your life!</li>

            <ul>
